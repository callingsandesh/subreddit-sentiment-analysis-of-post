No one watches a game b/c they’re dying to see the owner, they want to see the players. It would make sense for the cities that the teams are in to actually build them stadiums/arenas b/c there’s no fear of them leaving. You can actually build up the communities the majority of these athletes come from with the profits collected, hell no just them you can fund whole public school programs to the max. If a college GM can do it, then there’s no reason a GM appointed by the city can’t have a yearly review with revenue in/out and selections for trades/picks/etc.\n",
